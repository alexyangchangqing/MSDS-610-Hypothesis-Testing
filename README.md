# Hypothesis Testing with Python

Hypothesis testing is a process where sample data is used to make inferences about the overall population. This notebook covers examples of T-testing and F-testing to illustrate how hypothesis testing is performed and calculated using Python.

## Four Steps to Hypothesis Testing

1. **Formulate Hypotheses:**
   - Formulate two logically opposing hypotheses â€” the null hypothesis (H0) and the alternative hypothesis (H1).

2. **Compare Data:**
   - Compare the difference between the sample data and expected data under the null hypothesis.

3. **Test the Hypothesis:**
   - If differences are statistically significant, decide whether to reject or accept the null hypothesis.

4. **Draw Conclusions:**
   - Conclude to a statistically significant level based on the results.

## Examples Covered

The notebook includes examples of T-testing and F-testing, demonstrating the practical implementation of hypothesis testing using Python.
