Hypothesis testing is the process in which sample data is used to extrapolate information on the overall population. There are four steps to hypothesis testing:
Formulate two logically opposing hypotheses â€” the null and alternative hypothesis
Comparing the difference between the sample data and expected data under the null hypothesis
If differences are significant enough, reject or accept the null hypothesis
Draw conclusions to a statistically significant level.
In this notebook we cover examples of T-testing and F-testing to illustrate how hypothesis testing is performed and calculated using Python.
